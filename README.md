# Project React with Redux . 

This app allows users to manage a personal library by adding,deleting, and filtering books.\
Books can be added through three methods: via an external API,by generating a random book from a local JSON file, or manually by the user.\
Each book entry is tagged with the method used to add it (API, Random, or User).\

Add Books:
Via API: Fetch book data from an external API and add it to your library.\
Generate Random Book: Add a book with  data from a local JSON file.\
Manual Entry: Manually input book details. The app checks to ensure that no fields are left empty before adding the book.\

Book Management:\
Delete Books: Remove books from your library.\
Mark as Favorite: Highlight books you particularly like by marking them as favorites.\

Filtering and Searching:\
Filter by Author or Title: Filter the list of books by author name or title.The matching letters in the filter criteria are highlighted .\
